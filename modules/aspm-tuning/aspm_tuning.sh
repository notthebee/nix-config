# ASPM Tuning script
#
# This script lets you enable ASPM on your devices in case your BIOS
# does not have it enabled for some reason. If your BIOS does not have
# it enabled it is usually for a good reason so you should only use this if
# you know what you are doing. Typically you would only need to enable
# ASPM manually when doing development and using a card that typically
# is not present on a laptop, or using the cardbus slot. The BIOS typically
# disables ASPM for foreign cards and on the cardbus slot. Check also
# if you may need to do other things than what is below on your vendor
# documentation.
#
# To use this script You will need for now to at least query your device
# PCI endpoint and root complex addresses using the convention output by
# lspci: [<bus>]:[<slot>].[<func>]
#
# For example:
#
# 03:00.0 Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR9300 Wireless LAN adaptor (rev 01
# 00:1c.1 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801H (ICH8 Family) PCI Express Port 2 (rev 03)
#
# The root complex for the endpoint can be found using lspci -t
#
# For more details refer to:
#
# http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/ASPM

# You just need to modify these three values:
# We'll only enable the last 2 bits by using a mask
# of :3 to setpci, this will ensure we keep the existing
# values on the byte.

#
# TODO: patches are welcomed to me until we submit to to
#       PCI Utilities upstream.
#
# This can be improved by in this order:
#
#	* Accept arguments for endpoint and root complex address, and
#	  desired ASPM settings
#	* Look for your ASPM capabilities by quering your
#	  LnkCap register first. Use these values to let you
#	  select whether you want to enable only L1 or L1 & L0s
#	* Searching for your root complex for you
#	* Search for your PCI device by using the driver
#	* Disable your driver and ask to reboot ?
#	* Rewrite in C
#	* Write ncurses interface [ wishlist ]
#	* Write GTK/QT interface [ wishlist ]
#	* Submit upstream as aspm.c to the PCI Utilities, which are
#	  maintained by Martin Mares <mj@ucw.cz>
